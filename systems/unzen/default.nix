      # This section defines which servers NZBGet should connect to.
      #
      # The servers should be numbered subsequently without holes.
      # For example if you configure three servers you should name them as Server1,
      # Server2 and Server3. If you need to delete Server2 later you should also
      # change the name of Server3 to Server2. Otherwise it will not be properly
      # read from the config file. Server number doesn't affect its priority (level).

      # Use this news server (yes, no).
      #
      # Set to "no" to disable the server on program start. Servers can be activated
      # later via scheduler tasks or manually via web-interface.
      #
      # NOTE: Download is not possible when all servers on level 0 are disabled. Servers
      # on higher levels are used only if at least one server on level 0 was tried.

      # an article from one (any) of level-0-servers. If that server fails,
      # NZBGet tries all other level-0-servers. If all servers fail, it proceeds
      # with the level-1-servers, etc.
      #
      # Put your major download servers at level 0 and your fill servers at

      # were tried. If a connection to server fails NZBGet waits until the
      # server becomes available (it may try others from current level at this
      # time). This is usually what you want to avoid exhausting of
